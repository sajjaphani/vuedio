          "Every Monday through Friday morning for the past 4 years, I have gotten an email from my friend, Pascal. In fact, I have an entire folder dedicated to Pascal Campion with over 1,000 e-mails. And in each email is an attached image. It's his \"Sketch of the Day (SOTD).\" Every SOTD is a story that Pascal tells with his amazing talent.\n\nPascal has thousands of fans following his SOTD, but if you ask him, he'll tell you that they are not fans, they are all his friends. That is just the type of person he is.\n\nThis video is a glimpse into his process and his insight. Watch as he translates emotion into art.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nDirected - Anthony Vu\nMusic - Esther Wong (ywwonglp.wordpress.com)\nProduction Assistant - Nimalee Wickremasinghe\nEditing Assistant - Marcus Valerio\nSpecial Thanks - Josh Tran and Michael Shu\n\nPascalCampion.com\nOnyxCinema.com",
